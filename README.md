Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of software engineering is marked by significant shifts in how software is conceived, developed, and maintained. Here are three key milestones:

The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):

In the late 1960s, the "software crisis" emerged, characterized by projects running over budget, exceeding deadlines, and producing unreliable software. This crisis highlighted the need for a more disciplined and systematic approach to software development.
The NATO Software Engineering Conferences in 1968 and 1969 played a pivotal role in establishing software engineering as a distinct discipline. These conferences emphasized the need for engineering principles to be applied to software development.
This period marked a shift from ad-hoc programming to a more structured and managed process.
The Rise of Structured and Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s):

Structured programming, with its emphasis on modularity and clear control flow, gained prominence in the 1970s. This approach aimed to improve code readability and maintainability.
The 1980s saw the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP), which revolutionized software design by focusing on objects and their interactions. OOP facilitated code reuse, increased flexibility, and improved the ability to model complex systems. Languages like C++ and Java played a crucial role in popularizing OOP.
This milestone shows the movement to more abstract ways of building software.
The Internet Age and Agile Development (1990s-2000s):

The internet's explosive growth in the 1990s led to a surge in web development and distributed systems. This era brought new challenges, such as scalability, security, and rapid development cycles.
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged as a response to the need for greater flexibility and faster delivery. Agile emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback.
This era marks the change from large scale, long development cycles, to rapid, and iterative development.
These milestones represent fundamental shifts in software engineering, reflecting the field's ongoing adaptation to technological advancements and evolving needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning:

This is the foundational phase where the project's goals, scope, and feasibility are defined.
It involves gathering requirements, defining objectives, and creating a project plan, including timelines and resource allocation.
This phase focuses on answering "What do we want to accomplish?"
Requirements Analysis:

In this phase, the team delves deeper into the specific requirements of the software.
It involves gathering detailed information from stakeholders to understand user needs and expectations.
The outcome is a clear and comprehensive set of requirements that will guide the development process.
Design:

This phase focuses on creating the software's architecture and design.
It involves translating the requirements into a detailed design, including user interface design, database design, and system architecture.
The goal is to create a blueprint for the development team to follow.
Implementation (Coding):

This is where the actual coding of the software takes place.
Developers write code based on the design specifications, following coding standards and best practices.
This phase transforms the design into a functional software application.
Testing:

This critical phase involves thoroughly testing the software to identify and fix any bugs or defects.
Various testing methods are employed, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
The aim is to ensure the software meets the requirements and functions as intended.
Deployment:

Once the software has been thoroughly tested, it is deployed to the production environment.
This phase involves making the software available to end-users.
Deployment strategies can vary depending on the type of software and the organization's infrastructure.
Maintenance:

This ongoing phase involves providing support and maintenance for the software after it has been deployed.
It includes fixing bugs, releasing updates, and adding new features as needed.
The goal is to ensure the software remains functional, secure, and

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
